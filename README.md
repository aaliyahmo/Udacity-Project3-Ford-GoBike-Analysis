# Udacity-Project3-Ford-GoBike-Analysis

This is my 3rd and final project with Udacity for my Data Analyst Nanodegree

The dataset that I will be analyzing is the San Franciso, USA - Ford GoBike System data for February 2019.
The Ford GoBike was first established in the San Francisco Bay Area as Bay Area Bike Share in 2013 and later relaunched as the Ford GoBike in 2017. The system was known as Bay Wheels since June 2019.
The Bay Wheels has 3 pricing options which you need to know as its part of the dataset. A person can be a subscriber, who pays monthly or yearly or subscribe to Bike Share for All which is an annual fee and a non-subscriber who pays for each trip.
